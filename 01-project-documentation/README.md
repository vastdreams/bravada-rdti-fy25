# PATH: 01-project-documentation/README.md
# PURPOSE:
# - Contains project plans, scope definitions, and administrative documentation for RDTI claim.
# - Documents what R&D activities are being claimed and why they qualify.

# ROLE IN ARCHITECTURE:
# - Foundation layer: defines the scope and basis for the entire RDTI filing.

# MAIN EXPORTS:
# - Project scope documents
# - R&D activity descriptions
# - Administrative records

# NON-RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - Does NOT contain evidence (see 02-evidence/)
# - Does NOT contain completed filing forms (see 03-filing-documents/)

# NOTES FOR FUTURE AI:
# - When documenting new R&D projects, clearly state the technical uncertainty being addressed
# - Link each project to specific evidence in 02-evidence/
# - Maintain clear separation between project description and supporting evidence

# Project Documentation

This directory contains the foundational documentation that defines the R&D projects being claimed under RDTI.

## Required Documents

### Project Scope Documents
- **Project Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of each R&D project
- **Technical Objectives**: What technical problems are being solved
- **Uncertainty Statements**: Why the outcomes were uncertain at project start
- **Project Timelines**: Start and end dates for each project

### Administrative Records
- **Project Charters**: Formal project initiation documents
- **Budget Approvals**: R&D budget allocations
- **Resource Allocations**: Team assignments to R&D projects

## Document Naming Convention

Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD_[document-type]_[project-name].md` or `.pdf`

Examples:
- `2024-01-15_project-description_digital-twin-platform.md`
- `2024-02-01_technical-objectives_ai-routing-system.pdf`

## RDTI Qualification Criteria

Each project must demonstrate:
1. **Technical Uncertainty**: The outcome was not known or determinable at project start
2. **Systematic Investigation**: Methodical approach to resolving uncertainty
3. **Technical Advancement**: Contribution to knowledge in relevant field
4. **Experimental Activities**: Testing hypotheses, trial and error, iteration

## Checklist

- [ ] All R&D projects clearly documented
- [ ] Technical uncertainties explicitly stated
- [ ] Project timelines established
- [ ] Resource allocations documented
- [ ] Links to evidence in `02-evidence/` maintained

## Future Notes

- Consider creating a project registry spreadsheet linking projects to evidence
- Automate generation of project summaries from evidence collection
- Set up templates for consistent project documentation
